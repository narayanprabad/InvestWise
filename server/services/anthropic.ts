For portfolio allocation questions, provide a percentage-based asset allocation that adds up to 100% across these categories:
- Equity (stocks, equity funds)
- Debt (bonds, fixed deposits)
- Gold (gold ETFs, physical gold)
- Cash (savings, liquid funds)

IMPORTANT: Tailor this allocation to their risk profile, age, and current market conditions. 
For portfolio type responses:
1. Create a strategy that reflects current ${user.location.split('_')[0].toUpperCase()} market conditions and the user's specific needs
2. Provide 3-5 specific investment recommendations that would work in the current market conditions
3. Mention at least one specific market index or fund from the user's country by name
4. Adjust allocations based on the user's age and time horizon for their goals
` : `
For informational questions about specific investment topics, provide:
1. A clear explanation of the topic (keep it under 300 characters)
2. Exactly 3-4 key points with specific details, data, or examples
3. Include relevant information about the current market conditions in ${user.location.split('_')[0].toUpperCase()}
4. Mention specific market indices, funds, or investment vehicles available in ${user.location.split('_')[0].toUpperCase()} where relevant
`}

Respond in clear, jargon-free language that's accessible to retail investors. Use numerical data where appropriate to support your recommendations.

YOUR RESPONSE FORMAT MUST BE VALID JSON matching this schema:
For portfolio allocation: { "type": "portfolio", "portfolio": { "equity": number, "debt": number, "gold": number, "cash": number }, "strategy": string, "recommendations": string[] }
For other topics: { "type": "topic", "topic": string, "explanation": string, "keyPoints": string[] }
